# rshinyapp

#What is this?

This repository is hosting a homework assignment for CSC3220-001 at Tennessee Technological University. The assignment was to publish a Shiny app we created as a class assignment on a publicly accessible domain. In order to launch this Shiny app in R you need to run the following command:

runGitHub("<repository name>", "<username>")
 
You will also need to have included all of the required libraries to support Shiny apps.
